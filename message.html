     September 18th, 2024 —The day we started talking… 8 PM nunchi morning 4 AM varaku.<br>
Who would’ve thought…<br>
That those endless chats would become a place I now call “peace.”<br>
That those random chats would become the most important conversations of my day.<br><br>

We’ve laughed like idiots,<br>
Teased each other with names like kothi, pandhi, and god-knows-what 🙈<br>
You’ve ranted, I’ve ranted,<br>
You’ve cried, I’ve panicked.<br>
I’ve given free lectures… and you’ve not listened 😂<br>
Only to come crying later…<br>
And me? Of course, I consoled you. Because that’s us.<br><br>

You’re the only one who’s seen all my mood swings —(yes, more than you, I know. Don’t roll your eyes 😤)<br>
End of every month, I explode like a sad volcano…And yet, there you are — listening, understanding, staying.<br>
How? Why? I don’t even know. But I’m glad you do.<br><br>

You shared your stories — your pain, your present, your past,stories, worries, memories, and nonsense without hesitation.And no matter what… you’ve always matched my energy with your own.
And for me… you became that one person<br>
who knows everything, without ever meeting my eyes in class.<br><br>

The funniest part?<br>
We’re classmates.<br>
But we don’t talk much in college.<br>
No one even knows how close we are 😌<br>
It’s like we’re living a secret friendship story that only we understand —Hidden in DMs, full of real emotions.<br><br>

On your birthday, I just want to say this —You’re one of the few people who can handle me.<br>
And you’ve done it with patience, madness, and care.<br>
You’re not just a friend —You’re a constant in my life. Someone I’m truly grateful for.<br><br>

So Happy Birthday ra mental 💫<br>
You better read all this, blush a bit, and act like you’re not emotional —But I know you are 😂<br>
Stay the same wild, stubborn, crying-yet-smiling Asma.<br>
I’ll always be here — teasing, advising, understanding… and annoying you forever 😌
